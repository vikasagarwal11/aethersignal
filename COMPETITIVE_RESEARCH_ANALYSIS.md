## 12. ENTERPRISE READINESS & COMPLIANCE ROADMAP

Enterprise buyers will ask: "What do you have today, and what is on the 12–24 month roadmap?"

### 12.1 Current Scope (MVP / V1)

- **Signal detection & analytics engine**, not a full case management system.
- Capabilities:
  - Interactive **FAERS ingestion and analysis**.
  - **Natural language querying** of safety data.
  - **Social AE ingestion and exploration**.
  - Quantum‑inspired **signal ranking** and standard stats (PRR/ROR/IC, 2×2 tables).
  - Upload/ingest **vendor‑agnostic CSV/Excel/FAERS‑like datasets**.

Clearly state:

> "AetherSignal is a **signal detection and analytics platform**, not a replacement for Argus/Veeva case management (yet)."

### 12.2 Near-Term Roadmap (0–12 Months)

- **E2B(R3) XML export (one-click)** from selected signals/cases.
- **Basic audit trail**:
  - Who ran which analyses and when.
  - Changes to key configuration (thresholds, mappings).
- **Configurable role-based access control (RBAC)**:
  - Admin / Safety Scientist / Viewer roles.
- **21 CFR Part 11–friendly features (phase 1)**:
  - Read-only audit log.
  - Timestamped actions.
  - Basic electronic signature hooks (for future).

### 12.3 Mid-Term Roadmap (12–24 Months)

- Deeper **workflow automation** (review workflows, assignments, approvals).
- Extended **regulatory reporting support**:
  - Pre‑populated summaries for downstream case management systems.
  - Tight integration with E2B warehouses and regulatory gateways.
- Enhanced **compliance controls**:
  - Full audit log searchability.
  - Immutable log storage options.

---

## 13. VENDOR-AGNOSTIC DATA MODEL & FIELD MAPPING

One of AetherSignal’s most defensible advantages is being **vendor‑agnostic** and **schema‑flexible**.

### 13.1 Problem with Fixed Schemas

- Traditional systems (Argus/Vault/ArisGlobal) assume **one fixed data model**.
- In reality, safety data comes from:
  - FAERS/VAERS/CAERS and other public sources.
  - CRO‑specific formats.
  - Excel spreadsheets and legacy exports.
  - Social media / call center / CRM systems.

### 13.2 AetherSignal’s Approach

- Maintain an internal **canonical safety schema** (case ID, drug, reaction, seriousness, dates, demographics, outcome, source, etc.).
- Allow users to:
  - Upload **any tabular dataset** (CSV/Excel/FAERS‑like).
  - **Inspect detected columns** (auto‑mapping).
  - **Manually map** their columns to the canonical schema:
    - `case_id`, `patient_id`, `drug_name`, `reaction_term`, `seriousness`, `country`, `age`, `sex`, `onset_date`, `report_date`, etc.
  - Save mappings as **reusable templates** per source/vendor (future enhancement).

### 13.3 Benefits

- Removes dependency on any **pre‑built structure or single vendor**.
- Makes AetherSignal a **true ingestion/analytics layer** on top of *any* safety dataset.
- Supports a roadmap where:
  - New schemas (e.g., E2B imports, local HA formats) require **configuration**, not major code changes.

---

## 14. VALIDATION & LIMITATIONS (NLP + SOCIAL AE)

To be credible with pharma/regulators, AetherSignal must be transparent about **accuracy and limitations**.

### 14.1 NLP Query & MedDRA Mapping

- Maintain a **benchmark set of 20–30 standard safety questions**, such as:
  - "Show me serious hepatic reactions for Drug X in patients >65 in the last 2 years."
  - "Which AEs have increased by >50% for Drug Y vs last year?"
- Measure:
  - **Parsing accuracy**: How often the filters match the intended query (MedDRA LLT/PT, seriousness, time windows).
  - **Precision/recall** on a held‑out test dataset (e.g., FAERS slices).
- Document:
  - Known failure modes (ambiguous queries, missing context).
  - Guardrails (e.g., show the interpreted filters back to the user for confirmation).

### 14.2 Social AE Limitations (Critical for Trust)

Be explicit that social AE is **hypothesis‑generating**, not confirmatory:

- High **false positive rate** (sarcasm, off‑label chatter, rumors).
- **No causal confirmation** — mentions do not equal causality.
- **Duplicate posts** across platforms and re‑shares.
- Limited **clinical detail** compared to ICSRs.
- Potential **demographic and geographic bias**.

Include in product copy:

> "Social AE insights are **exploratory signals** only and must be validated against structured safety data and clinical context."

## 15. FUTURE DIFFERENTIATORS & FINAL POSITIONING

### 15.1 High-Impact Future Features

- **"Explain This Signal" button**
  - LLM‑based explanations of observed signals, including:
    - Plausible mechanisms.
    - Demographic drivers.
    - Literature references (when available).
- **Multi-drug interaction explorer**
  - Explore how signals change for combinations of 2–3 drugs.
- **Automatic MedDRA normalization**
  - Map layperson language and social posts into MedDRA LLT/PT as a service.
- **Advanced FAERS/RWD visualizations**
  - Sankey diagrams (drug → reaction → outcome).
  - Cohort timelines and bubble plots by risk signal.
- **One-click executive reports**
  - Branded PDF summaries of key findings, with charts and explanations, ready to share with leadership or regulators.

These features make AetherSignal look and feel like the **Notion + Palantir for drug safety** rather than "just another safety database."

### 15.2 Final Positioning Statement

Use a consistent, sharp positioning sentence across website, decks, and demos:

> **"AetherSignal is the only pharmacovigilance platform that lets you ask questions in plain English, instantly analyze raw FAERS and other safety data, and see real patient voices from social media — at a fraction of the cost and complexity of legacy safety systems."**

And a shorter tagline:

> **"Modern safety insights for the 80% of companies that Oracle and Veeva ignore."**

This keeps the focus on:

- **Who you serve**: startups, SM Bs, and mid‑market pharma.
- **What you do uniquely well**: conversational, vendor‑agnostic signal analytics across FAERS + social AE.
- **Why now**: regulatory pressure + RWD explosion + frustration with legacy tools.
